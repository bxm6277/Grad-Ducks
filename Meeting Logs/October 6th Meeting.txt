MEETING WITH Mrs.Nola:

	* www.moodle.org is a good place to get it started
	* the database used is MySQL


MEETING WITH Mr. Patrick Landry:

	* he confirmed what Mrs. Nola said
	* he added we need to develop a Moodle Plugin
	* Moodle works with php and Apache - after installation backup everything
	* there are standard tables in MySQL that Moodle comes with, if we need additional stuff, we can create new tables
	* he is available for support should we need more help in the future, though he never created a Moodle Plugin before


CONCLUSIONS.. NEXT STEP
	
	* upcoming dates are 10/15 for Project Management Plan and Requirements Doc.
	* we might need to meet again the lady from ODS to talk about the requirements in more detail



Add your ideas.
